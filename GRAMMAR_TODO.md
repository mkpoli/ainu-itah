# Grammar — items to verify against primary sources

Open questions surfaced by adversarial model review (GPT-5.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, …).
These need a source check or an analytical decision before changing; the obvious,
self-contained fixes have already been applied.

## Glossing / analysis decisions
- [ ] **person-and-alignment** — in `eci-ko-urenka-re-yan` (Piłsudski text 25; Sakaguchi
  2024 ex. 3-38) the final `-yan` is glossed `1.A`, but the surrounding prose endorses
  Sakaguchi's analysis that `-(y)an` marks **2nd-person plurality, whatever its role**.
  Decide the glossing convention for the discontinuous `eci-…-yan` form (this sits on the
  disputed inverse-vs-Sakaguchi analysis); align gloss and prose.
- [ ] **negation** — `hanna` in `hanna mawa-an-ike` is glossed `NEG` but described as an
  apprehensive 'lest'. Consider the `ADM` (admonitive) atom, which already exists, if the
  apprehensive analysis is firm.
- [ ] **negation** — caritive is given as `hamo ~ hamu`, but one example has bare `ham ipe`.
  Confirm whether that token is plain negation (fine) or a distinct bare-`ham` caritive.

## Source-form checks
- [ ] **morphophonology / nouns-and-possession** — monosyllabic `-he`: §71 vs §72 of Chiri
  1942 appear to disagree on whether `kuu`→`kuu-he` (retained) or `ku-he` (shortened). Now
  presented as a variable rule with the attested `reehe` as the unshortened case; verify
  which Chiri section says what.
- [ ] **verb-structure** — the ditransitive example cites Chiri §68 `tampe huci ku-kore`
  with the Hokkaidō-looking `kore` right after the chapter establishes Sakhalin `konte`.
  Check Chiri §68's actual form; use `ku-konte` or flag it explicitly as Chiri's pan-Ainu
  citation.
- [ ] **verb-structure** — `ne` called "the single underived verb that takes a complement
  rather than an object" (Chiri §§27, 32). Verify whether `ye` 'say' / `ramu` 'think' also
  qualify; if so, soften "single".
- [ ] **verb-structure** — reconcile the singular 'come' forms: West `eh (ek-)` vs East
  `eki ~ iki` are both given without relating them.
- [ ] **phonology** — the rule "coda `*p *t *k` → `h`, except after `i` → `s`": confirm the
  `s` outcome is attested for `*t` after `i`, not only for `*k`/`*p`.
- [ ] **phonology** — `sahka` glossed 'chopsticks' (Asai Take text 5). Confirm against the
  source (Gemini flagged a possible 'summer' reading; the attested gloss is likely correct).

## Factual inconsistencies needing a source check (from Fable-5 review)
- [ ] **Sentoku Tarōji dates/place** — birth year given as 1872 (orthography §3.1.2) vs 1871
  (texts §26.2); and the letters localised to Otasan everywhere but "from Naybuci" once
  (texts §26.2). Determine the correct year and village; align.
- [ ] **Dobrotvorsky appendix** — "two connected texts" (dialects §2.2, texts §26.4) vs
  "three short connected pieces — a farewell address and two reconciliation dialogues"
  (orthography §3.1.1). Verify the count.
- [ ] **Asai Take corpus size/dates** — "54 tales" (TAM, evidentiality) vs `murasaki2001:text 92`
  cited in numerals (impossible if only 54); recording window "1986–1988" (dialects §2) vs
  "1984–early 1990s", with text 40 dated 7 April 1990 (texts). Reconcile.
- [ ] **numerals `asikne`** — Fable flags `asikne` 'five' as the Hokkaidō shape vs Sakhalin
  `asne ~ asisne` (coda k after i → s). Check Table 1 and the person-counter `asiknen`;
  decide whether `asikne` should be `asisne`.
- [ ] **person-and-alignment `-(y)an` gloss** (also from GPT-5.5) — Ex with `eci-…-yan` glosses
  the suffix `1.A`, another Ex glosses `-an` as `2PL.A`, and the table labels `eci-…-yan`
  "1.A (KU/CI)"; the adopted Sakaguchi analysis says `-(y)an` marks 2nd-person plurality.
  Pick ONE convention across the chapter (entangled with the inverse-vs-Sakaguchi debate).
- [ ] **`kun(i)` gloss** — 'going.to' (person-and-alignment, TAM) vs `COND` (complementation,
  negation, relative-clauses). Decide one label (prospective vs conditional-irrealis) or
  distinguish two morphemes explicitly.
- [ ] **morphophonology `sistoh` 'elbow'** — Fable: Hattori's Rayciska form is `sittoh` /
  `sittokihi` (< `sittok`); `sist-` looks corrupt. Verify against Hattori 1964.
- [ ] **pronouns `taan` "far distal"** — `taan` is transparently `ta-an` (proximal/medial root
  `ta-`); a "far distal" built on it vs distal `tara(-an)` needs a source (Murasaki 2025).

## Glossing-convention decisions (from DeepSeek-V4 / GPT-5.5 round-2)
- [ ] **possessed `-hV` glossed three ways** — `NMLZ` (nouns-and-possession), `PERS`
  (evidentiality perception-noun construction), `POSS` (nominalization). The grammar says it
  is one form extended from nouns to verbs; decide whether to gloss it uniformly or document
  the context-sensitive labels deliberately.
- [ ] **texts gloss hygiene** — a `?` gloss ("one kin-? COP") and parenthesised `(INDEF.O=)`
  in texts §26 are not clean Leipzig; resolve or annotate the uncertainty explicitly.
- [ ] **`u-sam` homophony** — valency: 'marry each other' (< `sam` 'marry'); postpositions:
  'next to each other' (< relational `sam` 'side'). Add a note distinguishing the two `sam`.
- [ ] **`ani(hi)` labelled 3SG** but also described as a respectful 2nd-person address
  (pronouns §9.1.1) — note the honorific use or relabel.
- [ ] **orthography normalisation policy** — §3.4 says "we never normalise", yet the Sentoku
  morphemic line restores devoiced vowels (`цкін`→`cikin`). Distinguish phonemic restoration
  from dialect normalisation in the policy statement.
- [ ] **relative-clauses oblique stranding** (GPT-5.5) — the strandable set `ani/tura/pahno`
  (and `onne` for dative) is given as the Sakhalin counterpart of Bugaeva's Hokkaidō set;
  supply Sakhalin-attested stranding tokens or flag the inventory as Hokkaidō-based contrast.

## More (from Opus round)
- [ ] **`ucaskoma` vs `ucaskuma`** — Piłsudski's narrative-genre term is spelled `ucaskoma`
  in dialects-and-sources but `ucaskuma` (×3) in texts, with the gloss word-order also flipped.
  Pick the correct Piłsudski spelling and align (Opus: `ucaskoma` is likely correct).
- [ ] **Piłsudski recording dates** — "1902–1905" (intro), "1896 and again 1902–1905"
  (dialects), bare "1903–04" (phonology header, texts §26.3). The 1903–04 may be a true
  subset, but the phonology header reads as the whole-corpus date — clarify.
- [ ] **`murasaki1976:95` at evidentiality §16.6** was changed to `murasaki1979:95` to match the
  other two citations of the same `ku=ye-he sunke` sentence — but confirm which year is right
  at the source (1979 = grammar, 1976 = text collection; both "p. 95" was the red flag).
